# Thank-You
A farewell gift for my high school grade 12 math teacher, Mr. Van Der Schilden. It is a Desmos graph of his face.

The graph was generated using a program, from the following image.

I used the code from [this great repository](https://github.com/kevinjycui/DesmosBezierRenderer) by Kevin Cui.
